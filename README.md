- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance are vehicle length and ground clearance.
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
No it is not, as a low p value is an indicator that the slope is not zero.
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes, as the R squared in this example is approximately .71, meaning generally 71% of data would be statistically relevant to our line of regression. A higher r squared means the data fits the regression model better, and anything really over 50 percent is relevant.
